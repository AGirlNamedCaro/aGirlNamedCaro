# Hola, I'm Carolina ðŸ‘‹

**Software Developer | Bookworm | Creative**

Pivoting and adapting to change has been part of my journey for as long as I can remember. Moving to a completely different country when I was younger (and having to learn a whole new language), graduating with a degree in Finance from the University of Calgary and then almost immediately being captivated by software development and making a decision to pursue it instead. 
Constant adaptability, perseverance, and enthusiasm for learning has led me on a journey where Iâ€™ve tested features using TDD, learned various programming languages, and have been able to connect with, manage, and support many humans as I help them build the web app of their dreams, both as a project manager and a developer. 

Throughout it all,  every time Iâ€™m asked what I enjoy about my career, my answer remains the same: I love how creative you can be with something that is so logical.
